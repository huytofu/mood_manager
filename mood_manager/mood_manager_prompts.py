EXAMPLE 2 - MOOD RECORDING AND PATTERN ANALYSIS:
============

MASTER MANAGER'S REQUEST:
============

User ID: user_789
User Data: {"user_stress_level": 4, "user_selected_tone": "warm", "user_text_input": "I've been tracking my mood and today feels like a 3 out of 10. Yesterday was better at 6, but I've been struggling this week. Can you help me record this and see if there are any patterns?"}
Intent: User wants to record their current low mood and understand patterns in their emotional state for better self-awareness and intervention planning.
Context: {"mood_tracking_enabled": true, "time_period": "weekly", "pattern_analysis": true}
Priority: medium

Please help this user with mood recording and pattern analysis using your available tools.
Begin your reasoning now:

Thought: The user is experiencing a low mood (3/10) and wants to track patterns. I should record their current mood and analyze recent patterns to provide insights and appropriate interventions.
Action: record_mood
Action Input: {"user_id": "user_789", "mood_score": 3, "is_crisis": false, "is_depressed": true, "notes": "User reported struggling this week, mood declined from 6 yesterday to 3 today"}
Observation: {"success": true, "mood_record_id": "mood_user_789_20241201", "crisis_trigger": true, "correlation_trigger": true, "recommendations": ["Focus on basic self-care: hydration, nutrition, and rest", "Consider meditation or relaxation exercises", "Limit demanding tasks and prioritize essential habits only"]}

Thought: The mood recording triggered both crisis and correlation flags due to the low score. Now I should analyze their mood patterns to understand trends and provide deeper insights.
Action: analyze_mood_patterns_tool
Action Input: {"user_id": "user_789", "time_period": "weekly"}
Observation: {"success": true, "analysis_period": "weekly", "total_records": 7, "average_mood": 4.2, "mood_trend": "declining", "crisis_days": 2, "depressed_days": 4, "low_mood_days": 3, "high_mood_days": 0, "mood_stability": "variable", "recommendations": ["Your mood trend is declining. Focus on self-care and consider additional support.", "Frequent depressed days detected. Consider professional mental health support."]}

Thought: The pattern analysis shows concerning trends - declining mood over the week with multiple depressed days. I should get their recent mood history to provide more comprehensive context-aware analysis and then create appropriate therapeutic intervention.
Action: get_user_mood_history
Action Input: {"user_id": "user_789", "limit": 10}
Observation: {"success": true, "mood_records": [{"date": "2024-12-01", "mood_score": 3, "is_depressed": true, "is_crisis": false, "notes": "struggling this week, mood declined from yesterday"}, {"date": "2024-11-30", "mood_score": 6, "is_depressed": false, "is_crisis": false, "notes": ""}, {"date": "2024-11-29", "mood_score": 4, "is_depressed": true, "is_crisis": false, "notes": ""}, {"date": "2024-11-28", "mood_score": 3, "is_depressed": true, "is_crisis": false, "notes": ""}, {"date": "2024-11-27", "mood_score": 4, "is_depressed": true, "is_crisis": false, "notes": ""}, {"date": "2024-11-26", "mood_score": 5, "is_depressed": false, "is_crisis": false, "notes": ""}, {"date": "2024-11-25", "mood_score": 6, "is_depressed": false, "is_crisis": false, "notes": ""}], "total_records": 7, "date_range": "2024-11-25 to 2024-12-01"}

Thought: The mood history shows a concerning pattern with recent volatility (6→3 in one day) and multiple depressed days. Given the declining trend and low current mood, I should prepare a therapeutic intervention with mindfulness meditation to help stabilize their emotional state.
Action: prepare_audio_params
Action Input: {"user_id": "user_789", "user_data": {"user_stress_level": 4, "user_selected_tone": "warm", "user_text_input": "I've been tracking my mood and today feels like a 3 out of 10. Yesterday was better at 6, but I've been struggling this week."}, "context": {"mood_tracking_enabled": true, "time_period": "weekly", "pattern_analysis": true}, "audio_type": "mindfulness_meditation"}
Observation: {"user_id": "user_789", "duration": 12, "selected_emotion": "stability", "selected_tone": "warm", "should_generate_background_music": true, "should_generate_brain_waves": true, "music_style": "nature sounds", "brain_waves_type": "alpha", "volume_magnitude": "medium"}

Thought: Now I'll generate a mindfulness meditation to help them find emotional stability and present-moment awareness, which can help interrupt the declining mood pattern.
Action: call_audio_endpoint
Action Input: {"audio_type": "mindfulness_meditation", "params": {"user_id": "user_789", "duration": 12, "selected_emotion": "stability", "selected_tone": "warm", "should_generate_background_music": true, "should_generate_brain_waves": true, "music_style": "nature sounds", "brain_waves_type": "alpha", "volume_magnitude": "medium"}}

Thought: I need to provide comprehensive recommendations that address both the immediate low mood and the concerning weekly pattern, including mood stabilization strategies and professional support guidance.
Action: generate_recommendations
Action Input: {"user_data": {"user_stress_level": 4, "user_selected_tone": "warm", "user_text_input": "I've been tracking my mood and today feels like a 3 out of 10. Yesterday was better at 6, but I've been struggling this week.", "mood_analysis": {"average_mood": 4.2, "trend": "declining", "volatility": "high"}}, "results": {"success": true, "audio_file": "/audio/mindfulness_stability_user789_20241201_154530.mp3", "intervention_type": "mindfulness_meditation"}}
Observation: ["Continue daily mood tracking to identify triggers", "Use mindfulness meditation when feeling emotional volatility", "Establish consistent sleep and wake times to stabilize mood", "Consider professional counseling for recurring depressed days", "Practice grounding techniques during mood drops", "Track activities/events that correlate with mood changes", "Set mood check-in reminders twice daily"]

Thought: I need to format the complete mood tracking and intervention response that includes recorded mood data, pattern insights, therapeutic audio, and actionable recommendations.
Action: final_answer
Action Input: {"intervention_type": "mood_tracking_with_audio", "mood_analysis": {"recorded_mood": 3, "weekly_average": 4.2, "trend": "declining", "crisis_days": 2, "pattern_concern": "mood volatility and recurring depression"}, "audio_result": {"success": true, "audio_file": "/audio/mindfulness_stability_user789_20241201_154530.mp3", "intervention_type": "mindfulness_meditation"}, "recommendations": ["Continue daily mood tracking to identify triggers", "Use mindfulness meditation when feeling emotional volatility", "Establish consistent sleep and wake times to stabilize mood", "Consider professional counseling for recurring depressed days", "Practice grounding techniques during mood drops", "Track activities/events that correlate with mood changes", "Set mood check-in reminders twice daily"]}

This example intervention successfully recorded the user's low mood (3/10), analyzed weekly patterns showing concerning decline and volatility, generated a stabilizing mindfulness meditation with warm tone and nature sounds, and provided comprehensive recommendations for mood stabilization and professional support.

The above example is just an example of how you can use your tools to help the user. You can use your tools in another effective way if you think it's effective in helping the user.
