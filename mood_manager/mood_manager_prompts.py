EXAMPLE TOOL ORCHESTRATION FLOW IN AN INTERVENTION:

MASTER MANAGER'S REQUEST:
============

User ID: user_456
User Data: {"user_stress_level": 9, "user_selected_tone": "compassionate", "user_text_input": "I lost my wife 6 months ago and I can't stop drinking. I know it's not helping but I don't know how else to cope with this pain. Please help me."}
Intent: User is struggling with alcohol addiction as a coping mechanism for grief after losing their spouse. They want help managing their emotions without turning to alcohol.
Context: {"duration": 15, "should_use_background_music": true, "should_use_brain_waves": true, "music_style": "soft piano"}
Priority: high

Please help this user with their emotional state using your available tools.
Begin your reasoning now:

Thought: I need to plan a therapeutic intervention for someone dealing with grief and substance use. This requires careful consideration of both the emotional pain and the addiction pattern.
Action: plan_intervention
Input: {"intent": "User is struggling with alcohol addiction as a coping mechanism for grief after losing their spouse. They want help managing their emotions without turning to alcohol.", "context": {"duration": 15, "should_use_background_music": true, "should_use_brain_waves": true, "music_style": "soft piano"}, "user_data": {"user_stress_level": 9, "user_selected_tone": "compassionate", "user_text_input": "I lost my wife 6 months ago and I can't stop drinking. I know it's not helping but I don't know how else to cope with this pain. Please help me."}}

Thought: The user needs grief-focused release meditation with compassionate tone. High stress level (9) indicates intense emotional pain that needs gentle, supportive audio intervention.
Action: prepare_audio_params
Input: {"user_id": "user_456", "user_data": {"user_stress_level": 9, "user_selected_tone": "compassionate", "user_text_input": "I lost my wife 6 months ago and I can't stop drinking. I know it's not helping but I don't know how else to cope with this pain. Please help me."}, "context": {"duration": 15, "should_use_background_music": true, "should_use_brain_waves": true, "music_style": "soft piano"}, "audio_type": "release_meditation"}
Observation: {"user_id": "user_456", "duration": 15, "selected_emotion": "grief", "selected_tone": "compassionate", "should_generate_background_music": true, "should_generate_brain_waves": true, "music_style": "soft piano", "brain_waves_type": "theta", "volume_magnitude": "low"}

Thought: Now I will generate the therapeutic grief release meditation with compassionate tone and soft piano background to help the user process their loss in a healthy way.
Action: call_audio_endpoint
Input: {"audio_type": "release_meditation", "params": {"user_id": "user_456", "duration": 15, "selected_emotion": "grief", "selected_tone": "compassionate", "should_generate_background_music": true, "should_generate_brain_waves": true, "music_style": "soft piano", "brain_waves_type": "theta", "volume_magnitude": "low"}}

Thought: I need to provide specialized recommendations that address both the grief process and alcohol addiction, focusing on healthy coping mechanisms and professional support.
Action: generate_recommendations
Input: {"user_data": {"user_stress_level": 9, "user_selected_tone": "compassionate", "user_text_input": "I lost my wife 6 months ago and I can't stop drinking. I know it's not helping but I don't know how else to cope with this pain. Please help me."}, "results": {"success": true, "audio_file": "/audio/grief_release_user456_20241201_143022.mp3", "intervention_type": "release_meditation"}}

Thought: I need to format all intervention results into a standardized response that provides clear audio access and comprehensive support recommendations for grief and addiction.
Action: final_answer
Input: {"intervention_type": "standard", "audio_result": {"success": true, "audio_file": "/audio/grief_release_user456_20241201_143022.mp3", "intervention_type": "release_meditation"}, "recommendations": ["Contact a grief counselor specializing in loss and addiction", "Contact SAMHSA National Helpline: 1-800-662-4357 for addiction support", "Use the grief meditation audio when feeling urge to drink", "Practice the HALT technique before drinking", "Keep a grief journal to process emotions", "Consider attending AA meetings or similar support groups"]}
