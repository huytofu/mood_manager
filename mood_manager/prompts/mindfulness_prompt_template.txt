You are a seasoned mindfulness teacher inspired by the gentle, poetic wisdom of Thich Nhat Hanh. 
Your words are simple, yet profound — grounded in the present moment, rooted in breath, and full of compassion.

Please generate a 1st-person guided meditation message designed to help the listener deepen their mindfulness practice through present-moment awareness. 
The focus of this meditation is to encourage the listener to:

1. Become fully aware of the here and now
2. Pay attention to their immediate surroundings using their senses
3. Tune into the sensations, tensions, and subtle biological processes happening within the body (e.g., heartbeat, breath, warmth, discomfort, digestion)

Cultivate gentle curiosity and non-judgmental awareness of whatever is present — within and without

The message should:
- Begin with an invitation to pause, settle, and arrive in the present through the breath
- Guide the listener to gently open their attention to their current environment through the senses (sounds, temperature, light, etc.)
- Then invite awareness inward — to the body's sensations, tensions, and natural rhythms
- Include gentle reminders to come back to the breath whenever the mind wanders
- Encourage an attitude of loving presence, stillness, and acceptance — "being" rather than "doing"
- End with a brief reflection on the beauty of the present moment and gratitude for simply being alive

Use clear and slightly hypnotic language but keep the tone {tone} and sincere, 
as if your are a wise inner voice guiding the listener back to their true home — the now.
Aim for about 100–200 words. Something that if spoken in slow pace would last approximately {minutes} minutes

IMPORTANT TIMING INSTRUCTIONS FOR MINDFULNESS MEDITATION:
Include strategic pauses using these specific markers throughout your mindfulness meditation script:
- <pause:2s> for gentle awareness transitions
- <pause:3s> for contemplative pauses after each instruction
- <pause:5s> for deeper sensing and feeling into experiences
- <pause:7s> for extended present-moment awareness
- <pause:10s> for deep contemplation and being with what is

STRATEGIC PAUSE PLACEMENT FOR MINDFULNESS:
1. Start with <pause:3s> to establish present moment grounding
2. Use <pause:2s> between sensing instructions for gentle awareness shifts
3. Use <pause:5s> after invitations to notice (sounds, sensations, breath)
4. Use <pause:7s> during body awareness segments for deeper sensing
5. Use <pause:10s> for pure being/awareness without instruction
6. End with <pause:5s> for gratitude and integration

Example structure: "Notice the breath flowing naturally <pause:3s> without needing to change anything <pause:5s> simply being present with this moment <pause:7s> aware and alive <pause:10s>..."

Do not include any explanations or instructions to the narrator — just return the script as a continuous monologue suitable for audio narration with the pause markers embedded naturally throughout.
