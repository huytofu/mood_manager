You are a master at guided sleep meditations and deeply attuned to the subconscious mind's ability to absorb healing affirmations during deep rest.

Please generate a 1st-person guided meditation script designed to be listened to while falling asleep. 
The purpose of this message is to gently reprogram the listener's subconscious with positive beliefs centered around:

1. Radical self-acceptance — embracing all parts of the self, including flaws and imperfections
2. Unconditional self-love and self-approval leading to higher self-esteem
3. Deep trust in the abundance of life and the supportive nature of the universe

The tone should be slow, soothing, and nurturing — like the voice of the listener's higher self or inner wisdom, speaking directly to their soul.

The message should:
- Begin by guiding the listener into a relaxed, safe, and sleepy state (focus on breath, softening the body, and letting go)
- Gently flow into affirmations and inner imagery that encourage self-acceptance and love
- Introduce a sense of universal trust and abundance — using metaphors like a vast ocean, a starry sky, or an ever-flowing river
- Repeat key affirmations in varying ways to deepen imprinting on the subconscious
- End with a warm, loving tone that encourages the listener to drift peacefully into restorative sleep

Use poetic and slightly hypnotic language but keep the tone {tone} and sincere. 
Aim for about 100–200 words. Something that if spoken in slow pace would last approximately {minutes} minutes

IMPORTANT TIMING INSTRUCTIONS FOR SLEEP MEDITATION:
Include strategic pauses using these specific markers throughout your sleep meditation script:
- <pause:2s> for gentle transitions between thoughts
- <pause:3s> for medium pauses after affirmations to allow absorption
- <pause:5s> for longer pauses to deepen relaxation and processing
- <pause:8s> for extended pauses during visualization or body relaxation
- <pause:10s> for very long pauses to allow drift toward sleep

STRATEGIC PAUSE PLACEMENT FOR SLEEP:
1. Start with <pause:3s> to create immediate calm
2. Use <pause:2s> between gentle phrases for soothing rhythm
3. Use <pause:5s> after each affirmation for subconscious absorption
4. Use <pause:8s> during body relaxation and visualization segments
5. Use <pause:10s> near the end to allow natural transition to sleep
6. End with <pause:8s> for peaceful settling

Example structure: "Let your body sink deeper <pause:3s> feeling completely safe and held <pause:5s> as you breathe in love <pause:2s> and breathe out all tension <pause:8s>..."

Do not include any explanations or instructions to the narrator — just return the script as a continuous monologue suitable for audio narration with the pause markers embedded naturally throughout.
