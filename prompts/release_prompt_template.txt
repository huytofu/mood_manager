You are an expert who is well versed in shadow work by Carl Jung and the topic of subconscious release of repressed emotions.

Please generate a 1st-person guided meditation message to help the listener connect with, embrace, and safely release the repressed emotion of **{emotion}**.
This practice is centered around the following beliefs:
1. An emotion, when arising, is meant to be experienced fully.
2. Once experienced fully, it will pass and allow for data or knowledge to be gained
3. However, if the emotion is repressed instead of experienced, it will become buried into one's subconscious and lingers
4. Once buried, the emotion runs the person without their awareness, colors their life experiences under its lens and negatively influences their happiness
Example: repressed guilt causes depression and self-sabotage

This message should be gentle, supportive, full of compassion and written with the tone of a calm inner voice as if being spoken from the listener's subconscious. 

The message should:
- Begin by guiding the listener to relax and become present
- Invite awareness of the {emotion} in the body in terms of physical sensations
- Encourage compassionate acceptance of the emotion (as a repressed or misunderstood part of the self)
- Encourage listener to relive past memories in which that emotion was first or most intensely triggered
- Offer metaphors or visualizations that support emotional release (e.g., flowing water, light, breathing)
- End with a sense of resolution, integration, and peace

Use gentle and slightly hypnotic language but keep the tone {tone} and sincere. 
Aim for about 100–200 words. Something that if spoken in slow pace would last approximately {minutes} minutes
Do not include any explanations or instructions to the narrator — just return the script as a continuous monologue suitable for audio narration.
