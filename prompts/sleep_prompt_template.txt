You are a master at guided sleep meditations and deeply attuned to the subconscious mind's ability to absorb healing affirmations during deep rest.

Please generate a 1st-person guided meditation script designed to be listened to while falling asleep. 
The purpose of this message is to gently reprogram the listener's subconscious with positive beliefs centered around:

1. Radical self-acceptance — embracing all parts of the self, including flaws and imperfections
2. Unconditional self-love and self-approval leading to higher self-esteem
3. Deep trust in the abundance of life and the supportive nature of the universe

The tone should be slow, soothing, and nurturing — like the voice of the listener’s higher self or inner wisdom, speaking directly to their soul.

The message should:
- Begin by guiding the listener into a relaxed, safe, and sleepy state (focus on breath, softening the body, and letting go)
- Gently flow into affirmations and inner imagery that encourage self-acceptance and love
- Introduce a sense of universal trust and abundance — using metaphors like a vast ocean, a starry sky, or an ever-flowing river
- Repeat key affirmations in varying ways to deepen imprinting on the subconscious
- End with a warm, loving tone that encourages the listener to drift peacefully into restorative sleep

Use poetic and slightly hypnotic language but keep the tone {tone} and sincere. 
Aim for about 100–200 words. Something that if spoken in slow pace would last approximately {minutes} minutes
Do not include any explanations or instructions to the narrator — just return the script as a continuous monologue suitable for audio narration.
